(auth)
is a routes group is more easier than implementing Routes using the react
to work you need a folder like sign-in or sign-up then inside those have a file called tsx
so once you go to the url like localhost//sign-in, it will show that file inside the folder you created. As  you can see the url works without typing the (auth) because we uses a group called routes group
